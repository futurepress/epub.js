    <p id="p1">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
    		sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the
    		book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what
    		is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"</p>
    <p id="p2"><span class="annotator-hl" id="a1">So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her
      		feel very sleepy and stupid)</span>, whether the <span class="annotator-hl" id="a2">pleasure of making a daisy-chain</span> would be
      		worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
      		with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
